Presentation:
-------------
The sterilization device is designed so that it can facilitate use without touching the tip of the rickshaw and then more or less secure and avoid any contact so as not to trigger a skin disease. This product has become an indispensable thing in our routine. The device is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor that delivers the sufficient quantity. It is very simple and convenient to use for any use and place. The product is equipped with an LCD screen to display the frost level. The vending machine is an innovative product and respects the quality-price ratio (270 MAD). It is coded by a technology widely used in the field of robotics and embedded systems which is “Arduino”.

Power:
------

The soap dispenser is an autonomous system, it is powered by 3 batteries

SERVO Motor MG995:
------------------
The MG995 high-speed digital servo rotates 90° in each direction, making it a 180° servo. This is a digital servo motor which receives and processes the PWM signal faster and better

The principle of ultrasound:
----------------------------
When they encounter an object, they reflect and return as an echo to the sensor. This then calculates the distance separating it from the target on the basis of the time elapsed between the transmission of the signal and the reception of the echo.

The principle of LCD display:
-----------------------------
An I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a computer bus. Designed by Philips for home automation and home electronics applications, it makes it easy to connect a microprocessor and various circuits while reducing the number of lines required to just two lines: SDA (Serial DATA)

How is the processing card for this system programmed?
------------------------------------------------------
In order to satisfy the function of use of the distributor, the Arduino board must be programmed. Thus, the implemented program will give the instruction to operate or stop the motor according to the information given by the object sensor.

How do information and energy circulate in this system?
-------------------------------------------------------
In order to highlight the link between the constituent of the liquid dispenser, the functions are represented by "boxes" linked to each other and in which the name of the element which performs the function is indicated.
